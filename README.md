# Wheels For AI

## Introduction
In this humble project, we try to gather useful code that can be replicated without
much change. While ideally, the best procedure is to generate a library, such as [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning),
it makes it much harder for AI researcher who needs *flexibility* more than *standard* code. 
Just try to change PyTorch lightning code to GAN while adding an augmentation pipeline. It would be 
a good idea to extract a confession from terrorists.

My alternative and humble suggestion is to copy a certain part of the code from a very well-written library
and then change it via *copy and paste*. While this would raise the eyebrow for every developer in this world, 
the need for a rapid experiment in research is just too much to come close to 
a standard product.
